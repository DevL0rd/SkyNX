# SkyNX+

This is a modfied version of SkyNX which fixes the AMD encoder issues currently present on the main branch. Also includes more user input for vsync options and allows you to specify a monitor when setting the resolution to 720p (This issue appears in multi-monitor setups). SkyNX allows you to stream your PC games to your Nintendo Switch without Android! Now on the Homebrew App Store!

Let me know if there's any issues with NVIDIA / Intel encoders as I can only test with AMD / CPU.

## Troubleshooting:
If for some reason the controllers don't work. Try the following steps.
1. Restart windows, and launch it again.
2. If it still is not working. And you have previously used In-Home-Switching, Try removing the ScpDriverInterface that In-Home-Switching installs. You can use the installer that came with it to uninstall it, or get it [Here](https://github.com/mogzol/ScpDriverInterface/releases/download/1.1/ScpDriverInterface_v1.1.zip).

If the streamer just starts and stops immediately, try the following steps.
1. Reinstall the xBox controller driver from the settings tab.
2. Try running it again, if it still fails, restart the system and try once more.

If there is no audio playing..
1. Remove the audio driver in settings, and re-install it. If it doesn't work then try step 2.
2. Restart windows and launch it again.

## Known issues
* Currently more than 1 controller is not working, please wait for update.
